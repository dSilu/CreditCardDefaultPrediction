### Problem Statement:
Financial threats are displaying a trend about the credit risk of commercial banks as the incredible improvement in the financial industry has arisen. The biggest threats faced by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients.
The goal is to predict the probability of credit default based on credit card owner's characteristics and payment history.

### About Dataset
The dataset used for study contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

Our aim is to make a classifier machine learning model that can help bankers to decide credit applications. Read more @ [Credit card deault analysis
